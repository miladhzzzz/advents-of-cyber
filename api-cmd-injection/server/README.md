The vulnerability described in the example is a type of attack known as Command Injection. Command Injection occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious commands into a system command that is executed by the application, leading to unauthorized execution of arbitrary commands. In this case, the vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the input message and potentially execute unintended commands on the server.
